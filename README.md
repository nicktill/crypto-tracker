This is a web app that allows users to track the prices of various cryptocurrencies. It is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and uses the [CoinGecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/api/docs/v3) to retrieve cryptocurrency data.

Deployed App => https://crypto-tracker-nicktill.vercel.app/

## Running locally

To get started with the app locally clone the repo and then install the dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/nicktill/crypto-tracker.git
cd crypto-tracker
yarn
yarn dev
```
The app will be available at http://localhost:3000.<br>

**Note** this is only needed to be done if you want to run locally, otherwise visit this URL: [crypto-tracker](https://crypto-tracker-nicktill.vercel.app/)

## Features
Display the prices of multiple cryptocurrencies<br>
Sort cryptocurrencies by name, price, or market capitalization<br>

## Future Plans
Add charting features for the platform to display 1h, 1d, 1w, 1m, 1y, 5y<br>
Allow users to select the currency (e.g. USD, EUR, JPY) in which they want to view prices<br>
Add the ability to track the user's portfolio and calculate total value in real-time<br>
Implement alerts for when the price of a cryptocurrency reaches a certain threshold<br>
